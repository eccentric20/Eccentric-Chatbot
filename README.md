# Eccentric-Chatbot
This chatbot has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is fully operational. Its purpose is to provide a convenient way for users to interact and receive responses. You can ask any question you have, and the chatbot will promptly generate the appropriate response.  One of the notable features of this chatbot is its responsiveness.
 The given HTML code is a document that creates a webpage for an eccentric chatbot. It includes the necessary structure and elements such as the document type, language, title, external stylesheets, and scripts. The chatbot interface consists of a chatbox with an incoming message, a chat input field, and a toggle button. The interface is styled using an external CSS file and includes icons from the "Material Symbols Outlined" font. JavaScript is used to handle user interactions and perform dynamic actions. Overall, the code sets up the basic layout and functionality for an eccentric chatbot interface on a webpage. The 'style.css' file applies styles to create the visual appearance of an eccentric chatbot interface. It imports a Google Fonts stylesheet and sets global styles for elements, including font family and box model. The code defines the styles for the chatbot toggler button, including its position, dimensions, and transitions. It also styles the chatbot container, header, chatbox, chat messages, and chat input field. Media queries are used to modify the styles for smaller screens. Overall, the code creates a visually appealing chatbot interface with appropriate positioning, colors, and transitions to provide a unique and engaging user experience. The provided 'script.js' code performs various actions and functionalities for an eccentric chatbot. It selects important elements from the HTML using query selectors and assigns them to variables. It defines functions to create chat list items, generate responses from an API, and handle user input. It also includes event listeners for the chat input, send button, chatbot close button, and chatbot toggler. The code dynamically adjusts the height of the chat input textarea, sends requests to an API to generate responses, appends chat messages to the chatbox, and handles user interactions. Additionally, it handles keyboard events and toggles the visibility of the chatbot interface. The provided code sets up the basic functionality for an eccentric chatbot interface. Here's an overview of how the chatbot will work based on the code:

User Interaction: The user can interact with the chatbot by typing messages into the chat input textarea and pressing the "Send" button or hitting Enter. The user's messages are appended to the chatbox as outgoing chat messages.

API Integration: When the user sends a message, the code makes a POST request to an API endpoint (https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions) to generate a response. The user's message is sent to the API, and the response from the API is displayed as an incoming chat message.

Chatbox Display: The chatbox automatically scrolls to the bottom to show the latest messages. When a response is being generated, a "Thinking..." message is temporarily displayed to indicate that the chatbot is processing the request.

Error Handling: If there is an error in fetching the response from the API, an error message is displayed in the chatbox.

Chatbot Interface: The chatbot interface can be toggled on and off using the chatbot toggler button. When the chatbot interface is visible, the user can interact with it. The chatbot interface can also be closed using the close button.

Styling and Responsiveness: The code includes CSS styles to visually enhance the chatbot interface. Media queries are used to modify the styles for smaller screens, ensuring responsiveness.
